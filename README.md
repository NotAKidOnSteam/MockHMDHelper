# MockHMDHelper

MockHMDHelper is a simple script that partially automates the installation and configuration of the MockHMD XR Plugin in the Unity Editor. 

The Mock HMD XR Plugin is made for building VR applications without an actual VR device, so it is a great tool for testing if shaders are compatible with Single Pass Stereo rendering within Unity Editor. MockHMDHelper automates instalation to a few collected button clicks.

You can learn more about Single Pass Stereo rendering in Unity here:
