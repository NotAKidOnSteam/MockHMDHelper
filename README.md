# MockHMDHelper
A script that automates like 4 clicks.

Kinda WIP, kinda just winging it. Not really sure what I am automating.

Goal is to be able to automate this for mass testing of projects during the transition period for those who don't want to check if their shaders function properly in VR. I guess it also serves a perpose after the transitional period, as those who cannot check if a shader works with SinglePass Stereo Rendering in-game can easily from editor.
